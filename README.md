button editor
============

This is a button editor that I have been working for quite a while.
At the moment this is the the button editor with most features customizable in the internet that I have found!

You just need to :
- Add your button tag to your HTML file;
- Import the CSS file of your button in the button editor;
- Link the CSS to your HTML file.
